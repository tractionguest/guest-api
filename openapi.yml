    The Traction Guest API is currently in **closed beta**.
    We're still building, testing, and fixing bugs.

    If you're interested in helping us get to version 1.0.0, contact your CS team representative.
    Only paid accounts are elligible.

    # Versioning

    This API follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which follows the `Major`.`Minor`.`Patch` format.
    In short:

    * The `Major` number increments when potentially incompatible changes are made.
    * The `Minor` number increments when backwards-compatible additions are made.
    * The `Patch` number increments when backwards-compatible bug-fixes are made.

    So, once the API is out of closed beta, and has reached version 1.0.0, some things may change.

    **However**, the developers at Traction Guest strive to keep things running smoothly for our clients.
    We plan to **deprecate and warn** before making any potentially breaking changes;
    you may receive messages that follow the format
    "this is deprecated, and will be removed in version X.X.X, which is scheduled for release on or after 20XX-01-01."
    Please note that the deprecation message format and content may change.

    At this time, we are not planning to make older or 'legacy' versions of the API available, going forward.
